# Pandas-with_Visualization_Project
Project Summary:
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior by examining various factors such as Purchase Amount, Purchase Month, Product Category, and Purchase Date. The goal is to understand how customers interact with products over time and how different product categories perform in different months.

We use Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn to create visualizations (like correlation heatmaps) to uncover insights from the data. The project aims to explore the relationships between purchase amount, product category, and the time of purchase, with a focus on understanding trends and correlations.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

Seaborn: Data visualization for creating the heatmap.

Matplotlib: Plotting library for rendering the heatmap.

Dataset:
The dataset contains customer purchase data, including the Purchase Amount and Purchase Month. Each record represents a unique customer transaction with information on the amount spent and the corresponding month of purchase.

Steps in the Project:
Loading and Cleaning Data:

Importing the dataset and cleaning any missing or inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering:

Extracting the purchase_month from the purchase_date and adding any other relevant columns for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the data distribution, customer purchase behavior, and product performance.

Grouping data by customer_id, product_id, and category_of_product for deeper insights.

Visualization:

Visualizing trends over time with Payment_method, category and purchase_month.

Insights:

Identifying patterns in customer spending, preferred product categories, and seasonal trends in purchasing behavior.
